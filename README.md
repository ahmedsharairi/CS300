# CS300
# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this project, I created a program that could process, sort, and display data from a file.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I compared different data structures' runtimes and concluded that a hash table would offer the most efficient implementation for this problem. Understanding data structures is important because it allows you to look at a problem and know exactly what structures and algorithms are needed.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some roadblocks I encountered when developing this program was just making sure to constantly check my code for errors by testing and debugging often. When dealing with nodes, errors can occur quickly, and if left for too long, can be hard to debug.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project helped me develop a more algorithmic mindset in order to solve problems. I can now look at an issue and visualize its solution, as well as the appropriate tools needed.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
During this project, I felt that I documented my code very well in a way that was easy to read. I also wrote code in a manner that made it adaptable by making sure not to hard code anything. Overall, this project helped me develop crucial skills that I can definitely utilize in the workplace.
