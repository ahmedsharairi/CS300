# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this project, I created a program that could process, sort, and display data from a file.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I compared different data structures' runtimes and concluded that a hash table would offer the most efficient implementation for this problem. Understanding data structures is important because it allows you to look at a problem and know exactly what structures and algorithms are needed.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Some roadblocks I encountered when developing this program was just making sure to 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
